# Specification_Pattern_Example

In its simplest form, we can say that the Specification pattern is a pattern that allows us to create reusable parts by encapsulating the domain information/rules we want.

Thus, instead of spreading lambda expressions belonging to the same domain rule within the application, we can manage all relevant domain rules from a single point and make them reusable, adhering to the single responsibility principle.
